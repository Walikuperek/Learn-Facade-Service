# State architecture for TypeScript application
This project is trying to explain how, why and when to use facade state management approach in the Angular frontend app.
It contains example code **(lib-usage-example)**, that shows how this architecture should look like.

## How to read this?
1. Go to getting started
2. Go to **Angular Lib usage example** and read each README.md
3. Take a look at code examples, they cover most important parts to create clear architecture, that helps with complexity
4. Then go to every folder within lib-usage-example (dto, enums, models, services, types, wizard-steps) and check README.md + code
