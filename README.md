# State architecture for TypeScript application
This project is trying to explain how, why and when to use facade state management approach in the Angular frontend app.
It contains example code **(lib-usage-example)**, that shows how this architecture should look like. Every folder contains `README.md`.
Read every `best practises`.
***

## How to read this?
1. Go to [Facade Getting Started](https://github.com/Walikuperek/Learn-Facade-Service/edit/master/facade)
2. Go to [Angular Lib usage example](https://github.com/Walikuperek/Learn-Facade-Service/tree/master/lib-usage-example/create-view) (contains README.md in every folder with detail info).
3. Take a look at `code` within `create-view`, it covers most important parts to create clear architecture, that helps with complexity.
4. Then read every README.md for: `dto`, `enums`, `models`, `services`, `types`, `wizard-steps`, mostly look for `best practices`.
